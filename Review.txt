Comments:
Pressure sensor:
Add second cheaper pressure sensor.  Position it after the one-way
filter from the exhalation tube (after Y-splitter) and before the HEPA
viral/bacterial filter.  Only used for calibration and monitoring
atmosphere pressure.  For calibration put both sensors in atmosphere
and compare readings over a range of pressures, create a correlation R
value to see how well they are aligned, if huge R then need factory
reset/re-calibration.
Keep cheap pressure sensor monitoring atmospheric pressure and
expensive sensor for airway pressure.  Adjust airway pressure
on-the-fly if the atmospheric pressure increase significantly using an
average windowed calculation.  Monitor atmospheric pressure for quick
time window standard deviation, trigger apart if stddev is in flux for
too long...unstable environment pressure means the expensive sensor
will be giving poor readings.
Also like to consider adding a 3rd cheap pressure sensor as a fallback
and to average the readings of the airway pressure.  Could be position
closer to the airway outlet after the Y-connector (intubation
trachea).  Ideally we need 3 pressure sensors(1 expensive and 2
cheap).  Three sensors will gives us enough for waveform graphics.
See sensor layout in diagram:

One close to the trachea oxygen flow, after the humidifier (expensive)
One before the Y-connector for inhalation flow (cheap)
One after the one-way filter from the exhalation tube and before the
HEPA viral/bacterial filter (cheap)

Ideally we setup the 3 pressure sensors as follows:

Pressure sensor box:
Box is completely sealed.  Is this a one-time sensor per patient?  If
not how are the vent operators going to disinfect it after each
patient?
From photos pressure box looks too too smalls, looks like ABS has
stress bending?
Why is there only one air tube going into the pressure box?  This
airflow is broken inside the box and this will affect the pressure
measurements, adding signal noise.  My understanding is it should be a
pass-through enclosure to let the air low freely from inlet to outlet.
Consider changing the rectangular box design into a standard 22mm tube
connector that allows direct pass-through, see this image (without top
cover): https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.electronics-sourcing.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F11%2FSensirion_Mass_Flow_Meter_SFM3300-D_300dpi-1.jpg&f=1&nofb=1
We could take this commercial connector and adapt the 3D model

Electronics

BOM
Motor choice is different to other ventilator projects.  Snow blower
hex shaft not standard.  Are they both able to run 24x7 for 30 days
without heat sinks?
Drivers: can we switch to a Arduino driver shield?  Easier to source
international and $20 cheaper.  Also has more mosfet outlets.  What is
the necessary torque and speed needed for the bad? Could we use a
stepper servo motor and drop the driver?

What's the benefit of Arduino Nano? Uno R3 has easier build and easier
to get international.  Also has build-in power regulator to reduce
risk of power spike and frying board.  A power plug can push more Amps
for more peripherals.  Cost difference is 2€ between Nano and Uno R3
If we are going to add more controls input or output, we should
consider Arduino Mega, to get more digital and PWM IO pins

16x12 LCD IC2 could be upgraded to a larger LCD display.  Better
contrast, large, allows waveform graphic.
